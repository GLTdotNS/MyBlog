# NONCREATIVEBLOG


I created my own blog using Next.js 13, and CSS/SCSS. This blog gives me complete freedom for customization and allows visitors to explore my information and ideas in their own web environment without using off-the-shelf platforms.
The theme of the site is about Scandinavian mythology and history. There is no similar site in Bulgarian with such accurate and quality content. 

You can see my intentions for its development.
